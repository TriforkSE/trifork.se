        ## Interested in working at Trifork?

        You should swing by at one of our [Events](/events).
        Most of them we host at the office in Gamla Stan.
        These events are a great way to learn more about what
        it's like to work with us, and you'll get to meet us in person.

        ### Interview Process

        If you have heard that our interviews are tough and technical
        you heard right — we are _tough but fair_.
        Our environment has a high level of competence, and we want it to remain
        that way.

        We value kind, thoughful, and considerate people. And our interview
        process is designed around finding a good fit for the team as well.

        So don't be afraid to apply! We welcome all applications.
        You can read more about our [Interview Process](/handbook#interview-process)
        in our handbook.

        ### Code Retreat

        A couple of times a year teams rent a car and go out into the wilderness.
        Here people have a chance to work on non-client-related projects,
        hacking on some cool projects together. Some of our most innovative stuff
        have resulted from these trips — and that is great fun is just an added bonus!

        ### Knowledge Sharing

        At Trifork we believe that it is very important that we always Leaning, Teaching,
        and Evolving. We aim to use roughly 10% of our time for sharing and teaching.
        For instance we do [Tech Lunches](/handbook#tech-lunches) — informal ad-hoc events
        here someone from the team teaches the others about a e.g. framework, a new language,
        a hobby project they have been working on.

        ### Helping our Client Evolve

        It is important to note that while _we_ may be on the forefront of tech our clients are usual not.
        All our developers are provisient in languages like `Java` and `C#` and these great technologies are
        the cornorstone of Today's IT systems.

        We are very open to learn new things and adapt. We love
        new programming languages and frameworks and we reevaluate our choices constantly.
        We think it is important that we choose the _Right Tool for The Job™_ but to
        do that you have to know all the tools at your disposal!
