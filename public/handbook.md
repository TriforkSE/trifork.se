# Trifork Handbook

You work at Trifork and this is your handbook. The handbook details how we work together,
which processes we have established, and tools we prefer to work with.
But before we get too much into details you should first understand the purpose of this book

Just like the world around us, our business is constantly changing and the way we work should reflect that.
The handbook is a living document and should be updated often. You should always question its contains but try to
follow the guide lines when there is not reason not to do so.

We have made handbook Open-Source and you can freely distributed to your friends and our clients. The reason we did
this was that we believe that be best way to work together is through transparency — The more our clients, team mates, and
potential employees know what to expect, the better.

If you think parts of the handbook is outdated please do not hesitate to send us a pull-request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/triforkse/trifork.se).

#### What the handbook IS

The handbook is an introduction to people (both technical and non-technical) to concepts we work with in our day-to-day
business. It also an introduction to our internal tools, e.g. for time registration and calendar.
We describe the most common meeting types and it also meant act as a handy look-up reference e.g. for a checklist when 
setting up a new project.

#### What the handbook IS NOT

The handbook is __not__ about specific technical topics, e.g. recommended frameworks in Java or C#.
It will not tell you what Ruby libraries to use, or how to configure PostgreSQL. Any language or framework specific
guides should be added to our GitHub account separately from this document.
 
## How we work

What it really boils down to is that we believe that to produce good software we have to empower our employees and our clients.

We have a culture where it is usually better to ask forgiveness that permission — because it gets the job done.
That of course does not mean you should throw
caution to the wind, but rather think for yourself. You do after all work here because you are an intelligent
individual, right? 

At Trifork we are all about transparency. That means we don't hide negative stuff, we "call a spade a spade" and don't
beat around the bush.

This means our client's should know when an error occurs, the level maintainability and technical debt in the codebase,
workaround and general suboptimal stuff. No piece of software is ever perfect, and this fact is better faced head on.
Having a client or Project Manager that is well-informed and in the loop, enables them to make the
right decision and is always the best way to go.

### Consulting

We make most of our money building products for our clients. In that sense we are not your run-of-the-mill consultants
since we do very little on-site, six month, "Body Shopping" assignments. We do most our work at our office, allowing
us to be efficient and work with collective knowledge of our colleagues at our immediate disposal.

No matter the assignment the goal is always to produce something great. We want to help our clients make the right
choices. We are on the forefront of technology, usually knowing what is just
over the hill, while our clients are not.

This can be a huge benefit for our client's, and is one of the main reasons that they pick us to help
them push the envelope. We are there to help them produce great software.

### Our Own Products

TODO

## Empowering Developers

In Trifork we strongly believe that developers should be empowered to create software in on their platform of their
choice, using the the tools of their choice with which they are their most productive. We call this a Low Governance
Environment. Having free hands to pick and choose fosters creativity an ensures that we remain productive and at the
forefront of technology. On the other hand it also has a tendency to generate a lot of fragmentation and hard to
collaborate across teams. Therefore this Handbook.

If you want to use another technology than those found here, you are encouraged to do so, but don't base your entire
application on it or any crucial  components. Instead consider using trial technologies as non-central components and
spikes.


## Planning


### Project Process


1. Find and Eliminate Risk

  - Defining and testing a set hypotheses.
  
  This was important in that it allowed us to follow what we saw and learnt
  rather than simply following assumptions or common beliefs about the customers.
  
  - Doing Research
  
  Information Gathering / Interviews / Sketches / Artifacts
  Cognitive vs Emotional Empathy
   
  Emotional
  
  This is often the most radical in its effect on executives and as a source of insight.
  
  This combined with the Client's Hypothesis lead to insight.
  
2. Design

  The question is "how do we build something fantastic".
  
  Innovation Workshop
  - Bring in customers.
  - Stakeholders.
  
  We are now confident that we are solving the right problem we set a limited amount of time
  and start to develop a solution.
  
3. Prototyping

   Paper or HTML
   
   HTML
    - Dislike Colors
    - Slower
    - Scales
    - WOrking at a distance
    
  Paper
    - Abstract
    - Focus on features
    - Quick

TODO: JIRA, Trello, etc.


## Knowledge Sharing

At Trifork we dedicate time to learn, improve and evolve. We all want to become better at what we do, and luckily we are
surrounded with intelligent people that can teach us stuff. Now, if we don't learn from each other we end up doing the
same mistakes over and over not even knowing that there are better ways to do it.

Everyone aim should aim to spend at least 10% of their time teaching others. This is an investment, but one we cannot
afford not to do! We need to pull everyone up to our high level of quality and professionalism.

Teaching can mean many things, and there are many ways to help others become better. First of just doing Pair 
Programming is a very productive and fun learning experience. You could also, write a blog entry do a Tech Talk, 
contribute to the handbook, write a language guide or framework guide for the company, or prepare a GOTO; Night.

In this section we describe some of the ways we can help each other improve.

## Recruiting

### Finding People

TODO

### Interview Process

We keep track of our applicants in JIRA. When we receive an application it is entered into JIRA so we can keep track
of the progress.

Our Manager, Thomas, is responsible for the hiring process. He makes sure that we reply to everyone as soon as we can.
We want to keep our standards high and Thomas also leads most interviews and ensures that the applications are up to the
task.

Evaluating applications is a joint activity and team members are asked to help take a look at the applicant's CV and
any code samples supplied.

We either send them a kind rejection stating why they didn't make the cut, or invite them in for a meet-and-greet
session. Either way the will be moved to a new column in the JIRA board.

#### Meet and Greet Session

The meet and greet is the first session and is a chance for us and the applicants to asses each other. Will the
applicant fit our culture, does the applicant find the work we do a interesting, and so on. We also
discuss Trifork's way of working and ask a few questions about the applicant's resume. This session will usually be done
using Google Hangouts or Skype and last about 30 mins.

We also require that all applicants complete a Personality Test. The test is emailed to the applicant.
It is two pages long and takes about 10 mins. to complete.

#### Technical Session

The next step is to swing by the office and have a technical discussion with one or two people from our team.
We have a prepared list of general questions about computer science, as well as one for Web Development, iOS and Android
and one for Enterprise Java, etc.

#### Trial at the Office

The final step is for the applicant to spend a full day with the team. We will pay for any travel and hotel expenses that
may apply. This will usually be a Friday and you will be pair programming with one of team members.

This way the applicant gets a real idea about what we work with and what the atmosphere is like at the office.
And we get to see how the applicant deals with a real job situation.

#### Making an Offer

Trifork's CEO, Jørn Larsen, has the final word about any new hire. We will send him the Resume, Grades and Results of the
Personality Test. If all parties agree that it is a good fit. You will receive a contract for digital signing on [HelloSign](//hellosign.com).

Once the contract is signed we create a new employee account and you get a new company email assigned. It will be comprised
of your initials followed by `@trifork.com`.

### Your First Day

One your first day you are welcomed into the team. We assign a mentor to you how will help you get settled in.
By now you should have received a Welcome Email with your username and initial password -- which you will have
to change when you first log in.

You should spend your first day getting to know people, setting up your computer (if you have received one yet) and
familiarizing yourself with our internal services like [webmail](//webmail.trifork.com), [calendar](//webmail.trifork.com),
and time registration.

Your mentor is meant to help ease your first time at the company and help answer any questions you might have.


### Your First Week

You should have been introduced to the first project that you are going to work on. You should also have made your first
commit to this project — it doen't have have to be anything major. You should get a copy of the classic book "Extreme
 Programming" and gotten started reading it. It is a classic and explains many of the methods that we value highly 


## Management

### Salary Review

Salary review is done on a annual basis — usually in August. We encourage our team members to know their market
so we can come to a fair arrangement that all parties can be happy with. It is in the interest of the company
to pay people what they are worth. We don't want our employees to discover down the road that they have been under-paid.

### Compensation

Compensation can be put together in many ways. You can suggest alternative solutions to just the usual monthly paycheck.
Be inventive and come up with ideas that will suit your goals and life situation. People with kids tend to want more
vacation, while others may be interested in training, or the company sending them to a conference that they are
interested in.

Salary is usually paid out on the 25th of the month. Before Christmas we pay out salaries a bit earlier.

### Quarterly Review

We want to make sure you are happy and find your work interesting. Some things can only be said behind closed doors,
between you and your manager.

Even though we have an "Open Door" policy and you should always come to the managing team
and let them know if something is wrong, it is important that we also remember to talk on a regular basis.
That way small issues don't become big problems.

### Company Credit Card

If you have a lot of expenses you can get a company credit card. We use Eurocard Gold for our employee cards. You
will still have to enter the expenses in our [Time Tracking System](#time-tracking) but the money will not be
transferred from your account for 60 days after your purchase. This allows our payroll team to reimburse you before
the money is ever deducted. You should ask your manager for a Eurocard form if you wish to apply for a card.
The card can also be used as a personal credit card in conjunction and has a few benefits e.g. travel insurance.


## Sales

### Fixed-Price vs Weekly

We prefer not making Fixed-Price contracts. It puts the client and us against each other right from the start of a
project. You can end up arguing over "what it said in the initial contract" while the project has evolved. To be able to
work in a flexible and agile manner working on projects on a week-by-week model, allows both to focus on what they really
want. It is impossible to know every facet of a project and there are always new idea and realizations that happen
along the way.

### Contracts

Usually the kind of projects we take on are:

- Project Design
  We help the client plan and evolve

- Nothing to v1
  These projects usually
- Maintain an existing project in a transitional period
- Analysis Report, e.g. Code Quality Review, Agile Process Review
- Aid an existing dev team until their hire someone of their own


### Morning Meeting

TODO


## Developer Setup

### Security

You should always enable full disk encryption on your machine and protect it with a strong password.
If you want to have a dual booting machine, e.g. between Ubuntu and Mac OS X and only have a single physical disk
you may have issues with your Operating System's build-in encryption not playing nice with others. You can in
this case look into alternative solutions like [TrueCrypt](https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm).

We encrypt our disks to keep our data (and our customer's data) safe from prying eyes. Having your disk encrypted
is the best way to ensure your data is not easily stolen.

### Slack

TODO

### Skype

We use [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) almost every day for communication, phone calls, screen and file sharing.
You should set up a special company account. We use the naming convention `<initials>trifork` for our accounts — which
makes it really easy to find others.

You can add Skype credit and put it into our system as an [expense](#expenses).


### VPN

If you are not at the office network and want access one of our servers like code.trifork.com which are not in the DMZ,
you will need to connect to our network with a VPN connection.

How you set up the connection will depend on your OS. You should set up a `IPSec` connection to:

```
Server: vpn.trifork.com
Username: <your initials>
Password: <should prompt every time you connect>
```

Our server requires that you put in a "shared secret", i.e. a group password. You can find the shared secret as well
as several step-by-step guides for connecting by going to wall.trifork.com and searching for "VPN".


### Email

We use an Exchange Server for our email. In your [Welcome Email](#your-first-day) you will have received information
on how to log into [Confluence](#confluence-the-wall-). There you can find information on how to setup your Mail Client. Just
use the search function and search for "email".

When you send emails for work you should always use your company email address. It is also a good idea to include a
signature like the following:

> Firstname Lastname  
> Trifork AB  
> Phone: +46 000 0000  
>
> ![Trifork - Think Software](img/trifork-logo.png)

Email is probably your most important tool. It contains an enormous amount of data e.g. project details, accounts info,
attachment. It is also one of your main resources for getting in contact with people. You will find yourself looking
for contact information in other peoples emails all the time and you should return the courtesy and include yours.

### Calendar

Just like with [Email]

### Confluence (The Wall)

We use a Confluence server for storing internal information that cannot be public disclosed in the handbook.
You can find information about anything from wifi credentials to VPN settings.

We also use Confluence as our internal Blog / News / Notice Boards.

## Development


### Project Checklist

- The project has up-to-date [Documentation](#documentation), preferably in markdown. Is it up-to-date?

- The project has a job on a [CI Server](#continuous-integration)
  It should at least make sure the project can compile or a minimal sort of boot test.

- Be in a GIT repository that is has adequate security depending on the project, e.g. Certificates and HTTP/S.

- The project has some sort of [Task Tracking](#task-tracking) that is actively used.

### Testing

#### Tests are first class citizens

We strongly encourage writing tests. Writing tests helps you produce better code. Every project should have automatic
tests. See continuous integration.

Test when it is appropriate, and test only what needs testing. If you are new to testing you should adopt Test Driven
Development or a variation there of e.g. BDD.

Writing good tests is as hard as any other part of creating quality software. Having lots of tests does not mean your
software is great. Testing the your software can help make your software stable. Knowing what to test and what may not
need testing is a skill that is learned by study and practice and it takes time. Here are a few good resources with
general concepts:

* http://sturgill.github.io/2013/04/15/tests-are-overhyped/
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5554600

The major benefit of writing tests while you develop rather than after the fact is that it produces testable
code.Testable Code tends to be better code because it is usually modular, has a clean and easy to use interface,and
interacts only with few other parts of the code base (low coupling).


### Continuous Integration

TODO: CI Server

### Continuous Delivery

All projects should be built on git push by a CI
Use Jenkins over CircleCI over TeamCity.
All projects should be buildable with single command
You are strongly encouraged to make a Make target called "ci-package"
You are encouraged to tag all build versions in git. See semantic versioning.


### Software Licenses

Software Licenses can be seem bit of a jungle to navigate at first. There are many different licenses even many versions
or variants of some licenses.

When doing Client Work, it is important that you know what kind licenses are approved by the client's legal department,
if any. If a client does not have an existing policy on software licenses it is our responsibility to both educate them
and make the right choices for them. This also holds for our own products and Open-Source libraries.

Generally you can divide the most common licenses into two categories:

#### Proprietary License

The publisher of the software retains ownership of the software which is somehow licensed to the user. These are seldom
used in our software and can usually never be distributed as part of an open-source solution. They are usually paid
copies so you will probably not include this type of component by accident.


#### Free Software License

These licences are can require that any software, derivative of the software that incorporates a material under the
license also be distributed under the same licence, in essence also making it Free Software.

For example the the GPL license requires any derivative work to also be released according to the GPL.

This does not mean that you are obligated to distribute the code. E.g you may create company internal applications that
use free software as long as you don't try to sell it.

Notable Examples: GPLv3, Copyleft

#### Open Source License

TODO


### Contributing to Open Source

We use Open Source software every day and on all our projects. We could not live without it. Therefore we also encourage
our developers to pay it forward and contribute to the open source community.

There are several ways to contribute, one is send patches to other people's projects. You can and should do this freely.
Sometimes our projects yield useful libraries and utilities that are worth sharing. You can release these on our GitHub
account, but they have to be of high quality, have a good name, and especially good documentation — there is no idea in
sharing if no one knows how to use it!

If you have a piece of code that you think merits becoming open-source, step one is to speak with your manager and get
some time allocated to ensuring its quality. Then you should submit it to our GitHub account and link to it from our
website.

Remember you are representing Trifork with your software. Copyright should remain Trifork's even though we are making it
open source. We use the MIT License for our open source projects. It allows people to do what they want as long as they
keep Trifork attribution.


### Git Repo Hosting

Trifork uses GitHub for both our Open Source projects and some of Closed Source projects. For most our projects
we use out in-house code server at [code.trifork.com](http://code.trifork.com/). It is important that you make sure that
the project's client is okay with hosting anything on GitHub before you create (even a private) repo on GitHub.


### Logging

Use an image with logging like ELK.
Use Rolling Logs

Use semantic logging patterns (LINK?)
Avoid log and throw anti pattern


### Documentation

* README file containing:

  - Brief project intro.
  - Developer setup guide.
  - Deployment guide.
  - References to any further documentation.

* Architectural document

  Top-tier components e.g. WebServices, databases, external systems, communication links.

* Tech decision:

  Choice of technology to solve a problem must not be arbitrary.

  But most often is. "Okay let's use spring and web sockets... What was the project about again?
  Choosing the right tool to solving a problem is crucial for the maintainability of a project.


### Makefiles

Makefiles are a great was to document common tasks in your project. Make is ubiquitous on all nix systems and it 
therefore a good way to install dependencies and set up a project.

When you take over a project from another developer, the `Makefile` is a key piece of documentation on how to get start 
and interact with the codebase.

Using an informal interface (i.e. a naming convention) for the `make` targets it allows us to build up infrastructure 
and scripts around `Makefiles` that work across projects.

In many cases you can store `bash` or `python` scripts that contain the actual code to be executed from the make 
targets, but having them be executed from the `Makefile` serves as documentation for new developers. In many
cases you will even call external build systems like `Grunt` or `Maven` from your `Makefile`. The makefile does not
replace these tools, instead it ensures that we have a consistent way of interacting with project, no matter if they
are e.g. Java or Python.

The informal interface is described below.

#### Target Naming Convention

Your project should normally contain the following targets. You may of course have many more, 

```
make setup
```

The `setup` target bootstrap a project.
It installs dependencies, sets up `git hooks`, creates databases, log files, etc.
The idea is that when ever a new developer clones the project, he can run `make setup` and
be ready to start developing.

This is of course not always possible to install all dependencies, and any additional setup
steps must be documented in the [`README.md`](#documentation) file.

```
make run
```

The `run` target compiles and starts a running instance of project. This is not always doable
e.g. for iOS projects it may not make sense, but in the cases where you are developing a web-service
or have some sort of `REPL` this is where you would do it. Usually you will also make this the
`all` (default) target of the `Makefile` so developers can just write `make` to get going.

```
make test
```

The `test` target is another important element. You can run your projects unit and/or integration tests.

```
make ci
```

The `ci` (as in Continuous Integration) target allows us to use a pre-configured job template on our
[CI Server](#continuous-integration). Here is an example of how the target will usually work:

1. clean
2. compile
3. test
4. create a deployable
5. create a git tag 

Depending on your project you may not do points 4 and 5.

You can check out our website's `Makefile` if you want [an example](http://github.com/triforkse/trifork.se/).

```
make deploy
```

Again depending on your project having a `deploy` task may not make sense. In other cases it may be used to
deploy to a staging or production server. Deployment should always be easy and painless. Having a `make` target
for it, ensures that you doing frequently and "the next guy" actually maintain it.

If you are doing continuous deployment, `deploy` could also be called from the `ci` target.

### Working Together

### Peer Review

Peer review is encouraged. Try to work in peer review set-up as part of your team workflow. If you are working alone on
a project, consider getting a review buddy and review each other's code across projects.

Consider mixing it up and do group refactoring sessions as well as a chance to learn from each other.

#### Review Checklist

- go through the [Project Checklist](#project-checklist) from the handbook and make sure the project conforms.

- Check the recommendations for the platform used in the project,
  and discuss and document if something diverges and is not already documented.

- Make sure that the project conforms to the platforms style guides. You should a styleguide for any language
  you work with. If you don't make one and share it.

### Pair Program

Pair programming is encouraged. It is great for knowledge sharing and catching bugs early.
Find a balance with coding individually and in pairs.


## Measuring

### System Monitoring

Disk usage, memory etc. should in most cases be handled by operations.
You should do monitoring using log aggregation. See logging.
Teams are encouraged to have team dashboards, on a screen, with kibana or duckboard.

### Log Aggregation

TODO

### Feature Flags

TODO

### Transparency

TODO

### Time Tracking

We do our time reporting through the internal tool [Tidsreg](tidsreg.trifork.com).
For each project that we have, there should be a corresponding row were you input the amount of time (in hours)
spent on that project per day.

#### Project categories
Projects are grouped by Customer -> Project Name -> Sub Category. Working hours spent on tasks or general office
duties not connected to a specific project should be filed under internal time ("Intern Tid"), e.g,

Trifork AB -> Internal Time -> Non-billable.

For internal time, please make sure you divide your hours into sub-tasks if you've spent a "significant" amount of time on
different assignments. See the section "Custom Description" below for more info.

For client-facing projects it is very important that you report Billable time as billable. There should exist such
a subcategory under each project name. For example:

Trifork GmbH -> Welath Analysis Tool -> Wealth Analysis Tool -> Analysis -> Billable

failing to do so means that we as a company will not get compensated (by the customer) for the work you have done.
Of course, equally important is that you not report non-billable time as billable.

See the next section for instructions on how to add/find the correct project to your Tidsreg.


#### Finding / Adding a Project to Tidsreg

A new project can be added if it isn't listed in the Tidsreg table yet.
On the top of the page there is a drop down-menu / search field that can be used to find the missing project 
(that is, as soon as the project manager has had time to create it). Use the "shuffle"-icon on the far right to
toggle between the search field and drop down-menu functionality.

Typing e.g "Intern tid" or "Internal time" in the search field should give you a list of options to choose from.

##### Custom Description
For all new project entries you can add a custom description through the link "edit voucher text" appearing immediately the project name.

This is useful especially when adding small "Internal Time"-tasks where you can 
more specifically define what you were doing, e.g "trifork.se website" or "GOTO night preparation" etc.


##### Long-term projects

By default, projects are added on a per-week basis. This means that once a new week starts, you would have to go through
the process of re-adding your projects to Tidsreg (as described in the previous section).

If instead you would like to have a project persist for a longer time, you can do so by clicking the little star icon that
appears to the left of each project name. A filled star means that the project will "stick around" whereas an outlined
star will make it dissappear by the end of the week.


### Expenses

If you have expenses due to work they will be covered by the company.
You can use either your private debit card/credit card or your [company credit](#company-credit-card) to pay.

You must always enter your expenses in our [Time Registration System](#time-tracking).
You will find expenses under the tab "Vouchers" at the top of the page.

The amount you enter should always be in your local currency (what your salary is paid out in). You should specify the
amount that was listed in your bank statement to ensure that exchange rates are correct and that any conversion costs
are included. Often if you pay in a foreign currency the credit card company will add a fee.

### Traveling (Booking)

Sometimes you may need to travel abroad either do you an company event, a project or conference.

Normally you will find the tickets and hotels yourself. This way out get a trip that suits you. We fly in coach,
it is cheaper and we would much rather spend the money someway else, e.i. buying you a new phone.
If you fly with SAS we have a company membership code that will give you a discount.
You can get the code from you manager. 

For hotels find something comfortable and reasonably priced and do yourself a favour and make sure breakfast
is included.

You can either pay with you [Eurocard](#company-credit-card) or ask you manager to pay using the Corporate Credit Card.
Paying with these cards gives you an additional travel insurance.

### Traveling (Expenses)

While traveling you expenses are covered by the company. Anything not related the assignment, say Theatre Tickets,
Sightseeing Trips or visits to the pub, you pay for yourself. But anything else is covered by the company.


### Agile Processes

Every project team must decide how they work most efficiently. All activity should be based on the Agile principles of
Scrum, Kanban, Extreme programming or similar. _But don't kill agility with agile processes_. In the end agile
development boils down to:

- do frequent deliveries (weekly/bi-weekly at least)
- be able to adapt to change (it will come)
- hold retrospectives to continuously improve the way you work together.
- get frequent feedback from your product owner and or client

All these components are important to ensure a good project.


### Team Retrospective

Every other week the different development teams have a joined meeting. In Scrum terminology it is called
"The Scrum of Scrums" but we think of it more as an Office Retrospective. The purpose of the meeting is to achieve
common goals that may be too big for a single team. We also use the time to share experiences, e.g. what works and what
doesn't, and generally try to improve the way we work together.

1. The meeting starts with any general messages from management. A facilitator is picked who will control the meeting
   making sure we stay on track. 

2. Then each participant goes up to the whiteboard and on a time-line plots their mood has been over past two weeks.
   Any significant events, e.g. a meet-up event or releases, are noted.
   This is a great way of gathering information for the subsequent discussions. No one should use more than a minute
   for this.

3. The team then needs a few topics to discuss. Some topics might have arisen from the time-line exercise others may
   just be suggested. Any topic from previous meetings that are still relevant are put as candidates again.
   Using [Dot Voting] the team then agrees on 2 topics to discuss for the remainder of the meeting. All topics are 
   written down in the [Team Log](#team-log) for future reference.

4. The two topics are then treated using one of the many methods for processing a topic.
   There are many good resources online for creative was of processing a topic as well as many books, like "Agile 
   Retrospective". One method that we have found especially good in the past is The 7 Hats Method.

5. The meeting should take no more than an hour in total and should result in a set of S.M.A.R.T.
   Goals that will make sure that our good intentions actually get realised.


### Team Log

### Legacy Code

#### Step by Step Guide

If you inherit code your first task is to really understand it. What does it do, what is architecture like, what are
the.

1. Have as many teaching/knowledge transfer sessions with the previous owner as possible.
2. Make your own judgement about the "quality".
3. Make sure you have a test safety net, before doing too much refactoring. LINK.
4. Don't fix what ain't broken.

The last point is probably the must tricky. Try no to be too hasty in passing judgement or applying your own esthetics
to a code base. Projects always have undocumented history and if you change something that is seemingly 'stupid' or
irrelevant could end up breaking the code or making the client upset.

In the end it is also about protecting yourself; if you break something that isn't broken you spend the time 'fixing' it
and then re-fixing it, and life is just too short for that. Focus on adding value to the customer.

Docker and Flocker
Bash Scripts over Ansible over ChefSolo
Ubuntu LTS over CentOS
Use upstart over systemd over sysinit because we prefer Ubuntu.
Use continuous deployment
Use semantic versioning of you software
